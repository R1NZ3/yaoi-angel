nicknames + any name you want to call me is fun and okay, i love 'em! ^_^

keep in mind im **14** , *18+ iwec / ***dni*** at all.*

i drive a motorcycle, i'm a writer, rentry maker, ig nothing else..

[i plan to get back on the rentry making , for now i won't and will focus on school .]

I ❤️ gifted and matching skins. ladies ❤️

i joke around a lot and do **not** use tone tags, tell me if you **hate** it .

i'm **rude** jokingly, if you see me *arguing* wih someone, mainly + mostly they are my *friend* and its **jokes.**

i **hate** talking first and **wont** talk first , please dont break our friendship because of that .

***i hide + block freely, do not ask why i hid you or anything .***

c+h and interacting is always welcome, as i am quite alone / lonely (sometimes its a choice!) :3
